            <p>
                She's really enjoying video games and zoom sessions with her best friend,
                Ingrid. It's great that they can still connect even with all of the 
                craziness of the past two years

                But, she seems to be getting better with some constant attention from the vet.
                And of course, she's always full of love and desperate for attention

            <p>
                I've been really trying to learn how to make things with computers. A bit of
                stop and start with programming and web development, but it's coming along now
                with the web development portion at least!
